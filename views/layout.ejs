        Stylesheets and Preprocessors
        ==============================

        You can always bring in CSS files manually with `link` tags, or asynchronously
        on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can
        take advantage of Sails' boilerplate asset management.

        By default, stylesheets from your `assets/linker/styles` folder are included
        here automatically.  Both CSS (.css) and LESS (.less) are supported.
        In production, your styles will be minified and concatenated into a single file.

        To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit your Gruntfile.
        For example, here are a few things you could do:

            + Change the order of your CSS files
            + Import stylesheets from other directories
            + Use a different or additional preprocessor, like SASS, SCSS or Stylus
    -->

    <!--STYLES-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/linker/styles/animate.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/linker/styles/bootstrap.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/linker/styles/login.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/linker/styles/uno.css">
    <!--STYLES END-->

<!--
    Client-side Templates
    ========================

        HTML templates are important prerequisites of modern, rich client applications.
    To work their magic, frameworks like Backbone, Angular, Ember, and Knockout require
    that you load these templates client-side.

    By default, your Gruntfile is configured to automatically load and precompile
    client-side JST templates in your `assets/linker/templates` folder, then
    include them here automatically.

    To customize this behavior to fit your needs, just edit your Gruntfile.
    For example, here are a few things you could do:

        + Import templates from other directories
        + Use a different template engine (handlebars, jade, dust, etc.)
        + Internationalize your templates using a server-side stringfile
          before they're served.

<!--

  Client-side Javascript
  ========================

  You can always bring in JS files manually with `script` tags, or asynchronously
  on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can
  take advantage of Sails' boilerplate asset management.

  By default, filesin your `assets/linker/js` folder are included here
  automatically.  Both JavaScript (.js) and CoffeeScript (.coffee) are supported.
  In production, your scripts will be minified and concatenated into a single file.

  To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit your Gruntfile.
  For example, here are a few things you could do:

      + Change the order of your scripts
      + Import scripts from other directories
      + Use a different preprocessor, like TypeScript
